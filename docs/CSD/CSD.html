<h1>Community School of Davidson Science Resources</h1>
<p>Community School of Davidson strives to create an environment where the 
individual needs of students are met and students are encouraged to achieve 
their full potential as life-long learners.&nbsp; This site contains videos and 
Tracker video models for teaching middle school science.&nbsp; </p>
<h1>Tracker Video Modeling</h1>
<p>The Tracker video analysis 
and modeling tool enables students to create particle models based on kinematics 
or Newton&#39;s laws and to compare the modelâ€™s behavior directly with that of 
real-world objects captured on video. Tracker&#39;s model builder provides an 
introduction to dynamic modeling by making it easy to define and modify force 
expressions, parameter values, and initial conditions while hiding the numerical 
algorithm details. Because Tracker particle models synchronize with and draw 
themselves right on the video, students can test their models experimentally by 
direct visual inspection.</p>
