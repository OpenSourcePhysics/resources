<h1>Sharing Tracker Projects</h1>
        
		<p>A <strong>Tracker project</strong> consists of one or more Tracker tabs and videos along with optional support documents (pdf, html), all zipped together by Tracker itself into a single file with extension <strong>trz</strong>. The project file automatically includes an information page with project title, description, thumbnail image and metadata for search and display in the <a href="https://opensourcephysics.github.io/tracker-website/help/library_browser.html">Library Browser</a>. Once you have saved a project as a trz file it is easy to share since it is entirely self-contained and self-documenting. For help building and saving Tracker projects see <a href="https://opensourcephysics.github.io/tracker-website/help/zip_resource.html">Help: Tracker Projects</a>.</p>
		<p>In this collection you will learn how to share <strong>individual resources</strong> as well as <strong>collections</strong> of resources. Click on the tree nodes to read more about the topics below.</p>
