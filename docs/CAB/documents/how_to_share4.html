		<h1>Step 4: Share your Collection</h1>
        <p>To put your Collection on the web:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Copy all resource files to a web (or local) server, keeping the subdirectory structure of your Collection intact.</li>
          <li>Set  the base URL of your Collection's root node to the server directory path. Be sure to save changes.</li>
          <li>Copy your Collection XML file to the server.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To open your web Collection, any Tracker user can enter the URL of the Collection XML file into the URL field of the DL Browser and click the <strong>Load</strong> button. The  Collection will open in a new tab. </p>
        <p>The Collections menu in the DL Browser provides an even easier way to open a Collection. The Collections menu is subdivided into three built-in &quot;library&quot; menus as shown and described below. </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="../images/collections_menu.png" alt=""></p>
<h3>My Library</h3>
        <p>My Library is entirely under the user's control. By default, it contains only a local (empty) Collection called My Collection. To add a new Collection to My Library,   open the Collection in a tab, then right-click the tab and choose the popup <strong>Add this to My Library</strong> item. To remove a Collection or edit  My Library, choose <strong>Collections|Organize Collections...</strong>.</p>
        <p>Collections in My Library can be opened directly from the Collections|My Library menu.</p>
<h3>Tracker Home Library</h3>
        <p>The Tracker Home Library provides links to high-quality Collections of videos and Tracker resources and is available to all Tracker users through the Collections|Tracker Home Library menu. To recommend your Collection for the Tracker Home Library, email the Collection URL to the Tracker Home Library editor, Douglas Brown.</p>
<h3>ComPADRE Digital Library</h3>
<p>The ComPADRE Digital Library, a part of the National Science Digital Library system, is a growing network of educational resource collections supporting teachers and students in Physics and Astronomy. As a user you may explore collections designed to meet your specific needs and help build the network by recommending resources, commenting on resources, and starting or joining discussions. For more information, see &lt;<b><a href="http://www.compadre.org/OSP/">http://www.compadre.org/OSP/</a></b>&gt;. </p>
        <p>Tracker resources on ComPADRE are available to all Tracker users through the Collections|ComPADRE Digital Library menu. To recommend a Resource for ComPADRE, visit the Suggest a Resource page at &lt;<strong><a href="http://www.compadre.org/osp/items/suggest.cfm">http://www.compadre.org/osp/items/suggest.cfm</a></strong>&gt;.
