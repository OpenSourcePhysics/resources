<h1>Step 1: Explore this Collection</h1>
<p>If you have not already done so, save a local 
copy of this Collection by choosing <strong>File|Save Collection As...</strong>.</p>
<p>To explore the local (and therefore editable) Collection, open the <strong>Editor</strong> by clicking the <strong>Open Editor</strong> button. The editor displays a <strong>button bar</strong> for creating and organizing resource nodes and <strong>data fields</strong> for defining and describing the resources themselves. </p>
<p>Spend some time exploring the nodes, data fields and buttons to see how they behave. <strong>Note</strong>: editor button actions can also be executed by right-clicking a node and selecting the action from the popup menu. The <strong>Copy Node</strong> action is available by right-clicking any node in any collection, even when not editing.</p>
        <p>Buttons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Add Resource</strong> and <strong>Add Collection</strong> (available only when a collection node is selected): click to add a new resource or subcollection node to the selected node.</li>
          <li><strong>Copy Node</strong> and <strong>Cut Node</strong>: click to copy or cut the selected node to the clipboard. Note: the only way to delete a node is to cut it.</li>
          <li><strong>Paste Node</strong> (available only when a collection node is selected): click to add the clipboard node to the selected node.</li>
          <li><strong>Move Up</strong> and <strong>Move Down</strong>: click to change the position of the selected node. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Data fields:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Name</strong>: the node name displayed in the tree: click the field and enter the name directly.</li>
          <li><strong>Type</strong>: the type of resource: click the field and select from the dropdown list.</li>
          <li><strong>HTML File</strong> (optional): the URL path to the file displayed in the HTML pane when the node is selected: click the field and enter the path directly, or click  the browse button to the right of the field and select the desired file with a file chooser. The path may be absolute or relative to the base URL. If no HTML file is specified, the DL Browser can display only very basic information about the resource.</li>
          <li><strong>Base URL</strong> (optional): the base URL used to resolve relative paths for the HTML and resource files: click the field and enter the path directly, or click  the browse button to the right of the field and select the desired directory with a file chooser. </li>
          <li><strong>Resource</strong> (disabled for collection nodes): the URL path to the resource file: click the field and enter the path directly, or click  the browse button to the right of the field and select the desired file with a file chooser.  The path may be absolute or relative to the base URL.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Note</strong>: be sure to distinguish between HTML pages that are displayed in the DL Browser (defined in the editor's HTML File field) and those that are opened in the default web browser (defined in the editor's Resource field). The DL Browser's HTML pane is not a full-featured web browser, but it does support hyperlinks. Clicking a hyperlink such as this link to the <a href="http://physlets.org/tracker/">Tracker Home</a> site opens the target in the default web browser.</p>
