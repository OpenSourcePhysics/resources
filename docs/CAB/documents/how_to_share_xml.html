<h1>XML Collections</h1>
        
		<p>An XML collection is built using the <a href="../../help/library_browser.html">Library Browser</a>.   This takes more work but gives you more flexibility and control of your collection. For example, you may include resources located anywhere, including other servers.</p>
		<p>Here are the steps to building a local XML collection. For a more complete tutorial see the <strong>XML Collection Tutorial</strong> collection below or <a href="../../help/library_browser.html">Help: Library Browser</a>.</p>
		  <ol type="a">
		    <li>Oganize your local Tracker projects and other resources within a single directory (with subdirectories if desired). </li>
		    <li>Use the Library Browser to create, edit and save an XML collection file on a local drive. The base URL of the XML collection should be the <strong>absolute</strong> path to the directory containing your resources. By contrast, all paths to local html files and resources should be <strong>relative</strong> to the base URL, not absolute. It's easy to convert absolute to relative paths when building the collection in the Library Browser.</li>
</ol>
		  <p>Once you have your local XML collection it is easy to convert it to a web-based XML collection:</p>
		  <ol type="a">
		    <li>Upload your entire directory (with resources and subdirectories but not the XML collection file) to a web server.</li>
		    <li>Change the base URL of your XML collection to the URL path of the directory on the server so that all relative paths point to web files.</li>
		    <li>Upload the XML collection file to the server. Open the collection by opening the URL path to the XML file in the Library Browser.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that your XML collection file need not reside on the server--you can also email it to others or share it on a local network. However, putting it on the web means you only have send others the URL to the web XML file.</p>
		  <p><strong>Note</strong>: If you have a web-based XML collection you are proud of, please email <a href="mailto:dobrown@cabrillo.edu">Douglas Brown</a> who will (if approved) add it to the Library Browser's <strong>Collections|Shared Library</strong> menu. It will then be accessible to all Tracker users, not just your students.</p>
