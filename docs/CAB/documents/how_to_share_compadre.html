<h1>ComPADRE Digital Library</h1>
        
		<p>The <a href="http://www.compadre.org/" target="_blank">ComPADRE Digital Library</a> is a network of educational resource collections supporting teachers and students in Physics and Astronomy. Here's how to submit your Tracker project to comPADRE:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Check that your Tracker project file is <strong>10MB or less</strong>. With large videos you should always check the Save Clips As checkbox to keep only the frames of interest. If needed, review your project to see if you can reduce the number of frames in your video clip (for example, by increasing the step size). Experiment also with different video formats.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Log into  ComPADRE (registration is free) and open the <a href="http://www.compadre.org/osp/items/suggest.cfm" target="_blank">Suggest a Resource</a> page. Unless you have instructor materials or other ancillary resources, simply enter the information in the Quick Suggestion tab, attach your Tracker project file, and click the <strong>Make Suggestion</strong> button. That's it! The OSP Collection editor will review your submission and, if accepted, create the full record for the project.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>If you wish to include additional resources along with your project file, use the Full Suggestion Wizard tab on the Suggest a Resource page.</li>
</ol>
