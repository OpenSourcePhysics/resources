    <h1>Student Modeling Projects</h1>
    <p>These video modeling experiments were created by Cabrillo College  students in a freshman calculus-based mechanics course. Student groups of 2-4 designed the experiments, captured the videos, created and tested the models, and presented the results to the class.</p>
