    <h2>Thermal Spectrum: Grayscale</h2>
    <p>This is the spectrum of a 60W "soft white" incandescent lamp with HeNe red (633nm) and green (543 nm) laser spots for calibration. The camera was set to record in grayscale rather than color.<br><br>Compare this spectrum with that in "Thermal Spectrum: Color," in which the camera recorded in color. The line profile tool obains an almost identical spectrum in both, indicating that the camera and tool use similar video RGB-grayscale conversions.</p>
